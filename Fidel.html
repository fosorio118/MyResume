		<h2>All About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Fidel Osorio and I am a high school student at Information Technology High School. I also am a novice at writing computer code but I am learning. I do how ever know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In fact I wrote the website that you are viewing right now. I am also a co-founder and data specialist for the startup known as Imago. My team and I are currently in development of this app.</p>
